What is Wanchain?
================================================================================

Wanchain aims to build a blockchain infrastructure that can be used to realize the connection and value exchange of different blockchain networks in a decentralized way. It uses the latest theories of cryptography to make up for the shortcomings of existing cross chain protocols. Any blockchain network, whether public, private, or consortium, can connect with Wanchain to enable the cross chain transaction of its digital assets at a low cost. Wanchain is not just a generic cross chain protocol, but also a distributed ledger that records cross chain transactions and native chain transactions. This ledger supports both smart contracts and private transactions. It is a major step towards connecting all blockchains and the creation of the Internet of Value. It represents major advances in the decentralized application of advanced cryptographic theory in the field of blockchain, as well as a new and complete blockchain network with high efficiency.
Wanchain is about to reshape the economic ecosystem of blockchain.

Differentiation with other blockchain products
================================================================================

The ultimate vision of Wanchain is to create an “Internet” of blockchain to achieve in which all the fundamentally isolated blockchains are connected together to form an internet of value. Within Wanchain’s ecosystem, thousands of chains will interconnected and value will be transferred freely without barriers, allowing blockchains to reach their full potential of carrying and transferring value. Wanchain is about to reshape the economic ecosystem.

Wanchain applies secure multi-party computation, threshold secret sharing, ring signatures based on elliptic curve cryptography, one-off account generation and many other cutting-edge technologies in order to achieve its cross chain and private functionalities. Wanchain boasts a professional cryptography research team who will continue to contribute to the industry as a whole by applying cryptography in the field of blockchain.       

Wanchain is more than just a blockchain project realizing cross chain transaction and interoperability between multiple chains. It is also a complete blockchain development platform. While achieving the function of cross chain transactions, Wanchain is also a blockchain network that can run independently: it has a native coin, supports smart contracts, and has a privacy protection mechanisms for token transactions. Any developer may develop application which meet their needs on Wanchain.
